<h1 align="center">Taxi Availability Singapore</h1>


<p align="center"> In Singapore, all of the taxis are connected to a central system that tracks their positions at all times. It's even cooler because the Singaporean government collects these data and anyone - including you - can obtain the data for analysis.
So I will collect the data for one month in 2019, and perform analysis, followed by modelling.

## üóÇ Data <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
The data is from Singapore government provided API at https://data.gov.sg/dataset/taxi-availability.

## Flow of project <a name = "project"></a>

1. Call the taxi availability API from Data.gov.sg to collect taxi data (Part I)
2. Perform data cleaning (Part II)
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (Part III)
4. Train a machine learning model to (Part IV)

## Part 1 <a name = "1"></a>

- Import your pandas library
- Call the Taxi Availability API from Data.gov.sg
- Organize the JSON data
- Export your DataFrame as a CSV file

## Part 2 <a name = "2"></a>
<img src="images/download (3).png" alt="Project logo"></a>
- Load the CSV that you obtained from Part I
- Convert the string representation of lists as actual lists
- Divide the coordinates of taxis into different sectors
- Engineer new features out of the time data
- Drop unneeded columns
- Export the engineered DataFrame

### Part 3 <a name = "3"></a>
<img src="images/download2.png" alt="Project logo"></a>
- Import pandas and data vizualization libraries
- Visualize the taxi availability over the month
- Visualize the taxi availability over the 24 hours in a day
- Visualize the taxi availability by day of the week

### Part 4 <a name = "4"></a>

- Split your data into train and test set
- Model creation
- Import your models from sklearn and instantiate them (assign model object to a variable)
- model fitting
- Fit your training data into the model and train train train
- model prediction
- Make a set of predictions using your test data, and
- Model assessment
- Compare your predictions with ground truth in test data
